;;; Commentary:

;; This plugin uses the xprop command to set an X11 property that some window
;; managers use to set the GTK decorations. This allows for a dark titlebar,
;; which this plugin sets by default.
;; This plugin will stop working on GNOME wayland if Emacs ever moves to wayland.

;;; Usage:

;; (add-hook 'window-setup-hook #'gtk-variant-set-frame)
;; (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions #'gtk-variant-set-frame)


;;; Code:
(defvar gtk-variant 'dark
  "Initial GTK theme variant. Valid values are dark and light.")

;;;###autoload
(defun gtk-variant-set-frame (&optional frame variant)
  "Set the GTK theme variant of frame FRAME to VARIANT.
With no arguments, sets the selected frame to the variable `gtk-variant'

Recommended usage:
\(add-hook 'window-setup-hook #'gtk-variant-set-frame)
\(add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions #'gtk-variant-set-frame)

\(fn &optional FRAME VARIANT)"
